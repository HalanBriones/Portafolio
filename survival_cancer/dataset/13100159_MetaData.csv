1,"Sources: An analytic file created by record linking Statistics Canada’s Canadian Cancer Registry tabulation file (1992-to-2021) to mortality information—complete through December 31, 2021—from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death database and T1 Personal Master Files (as reported on tax returns); population life tables. All sources are from Statistics Canada. The <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3207">Canadian Cancer Registry</a> is a person-oriented, population-based database that can be updated with new records or changes to previous records. As such, survival estimates may vary from one release to the next."
2,"The table was prepared using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Groups for Primary Site based on the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3). Included are all invasive cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and in situ for bladder. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) rules for determining multiple primary types have been applied (source: International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, International Association of Cancer Registries, and European Network of Cancer Registries. International Rules for Multiple Primary Cancers, ICD-O Third Edition, Internal Report No.2004/02. Lyon: International Agency for Research on Cancer)."
3,"Analyses were based on all primary cancers apart from second- and higher-order cancers of the same site. The following cases were excluded: subjects with an unknown year of birth or death; subjects under 15 or over 99 years of age at diagnosis; subjects diagnosed through autopsy only or death certificate only. Survival time was measured in days while variables for age at diagnosis and diagnosis year were measured to three decimal places. Cases with the same date of diagnosis and death (not including those previously excluded because they were diagnosed through autopsy only or death certificate only) were assigned one day of survival to avoid automatically being excluded from the analysis."
4,"Some provincial and territorial cancer registries differ with respect to methods of data collection and registration of multiple primary cancers (more than one diagnosis of a primary cancer). For example, because Quebec relies primarily on hospital data (that is, hospitalizations or day surgeries) to identify cancers diagnosed until the end of 2010, the number of cases of some cancers, particularly prostate and skin melanoma are underestimated (source: Brisson J, Major D, Pelletier E. Evaluation of the completeness of the Fichier des tumeurs du Québec. Institut national de la santé publique du Québec; 2003). Since it is thought that the “missing” cases are collectively more likely to have a better prognosis, the likely overall effect is an underestimation of survival."
5,"Excluding histology types 9050 to 9055, 9140, 9590 to 9993."
6,"Ontario did not report in situ bladder cases to the Canadian Cancer Registry prior to the 2010 data year. As the prognosis for such cases is typically better than for invasive cases, their absence would likely serve to decrease net survival for this cancer."
7,"Estimates were based on the cohort method of survival. Three-month subintervals were used for the first year of follow-up followed by six-month subintervals for the remaining four years."
8,"Estimates were suppressed if any of the following conditions were true: the number of eligible cases (at the start of follow-up) was less than 10; the standard error (of the net survival estimate) was greater than 0.1; the standard error was 0 and the number of eligible cases was less than 20; or the standard error was greater than 0.05 and the net survival estimate was 100% or greater prior to rounding. The use of non-suppressed estimates was cautioned if the standard error was greater than 0.05 or the net survival estimate was 100% or greater prior to rounding."
9,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
10,"Net survival refers to the survival probability that would be observed in the hypothetical situation where the cancer of interest is the only possible cause of death (that is, the survival as far as the cancer of interest is concerned). Net survival is the preferred method for comparing cancer survival in population-based cancer studies because it adjusts for the fact that different populations may have different levels of background risk of death. Net survival was derived using the Pohar-Perme estimator (source: Pohar PM, Stare J, Estève J. On estimation in relative survival. Biometrics. 2012; 68(1): 113–20)."
11,"Annual expected survival probabilities, necessary for the calculation of net survival were derived by single year of age, from sex-specific provincial/territorial life tables produced by Statistics Canada. Expected survival probabilities used in the calculation of net survival for prostate and female breast cancer were adjusted for cancer specific mortality rates in the general population."
12,"For non-rounded net survival estimates of 0%, or 100% and greater, the 95% confidence interval is undefined. In addition, the confidence interval tends to become unstable as the net survival point estimate approaches 100%, especially if the estimate rounds up to 100%, even when the corresponding standard error is relatively very small. This can result in a somewhat misleadingly low lower bound of 0%."
